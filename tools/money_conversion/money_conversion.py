class Currency:
    '''
    A class to help convert medieval English money into its various forms -
    pounds(£/l.), marks(m.), shillings(s.), denarii(d.).
    There were:
        12 denarii in a shilling.
        160 denarii in a mark.
        240 denarii in a pound.

    The input for this program is a string - type in the amount that you see in the manuscript (including finial j's if
    you wish). Case does not matter.
    The only order that matters is that:
        The currency sign MUST come after the Roman Numerals in ALL cases - e.g. xij l. vj s. iiij d.
